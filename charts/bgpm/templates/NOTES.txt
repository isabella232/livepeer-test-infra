The monitors will need to use the service account created by this release. To get
the token for this service account you can run the following:

```
# get token for services account
token=$(kubectl get sa -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Values.serviceAccount }} -o=jsonpath '{.secrets[0].name}' -r)
kubectl describe secret -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} $token
```

Then add a user to the kubeconfig bgpm uses to monitor this cluster. Be sure to
reference it in the context as well.

```
# add the token to kubeconfig for monitors
users:
- name: bgpm
  user:
    token: <token>
```
